    "section": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy",
    "text": "10 Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use Policy\nThis policy covers any generative AI tool, such as ChatGPT, Elicit, Gemini, Claude, CoPilot, etc. This includes text, code, slides, artwork/graphics/video/audio and other products.\nWe instructors encourage exploring AI tools for these purposes:\n\nLearning by dialog with a chatbot. AI chatbots can be helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive also false information! An AI chat can be a good entry point to learn about a specific topic but the more specific it gets the more likely it is that AI will start to deliver useless or wrong answers. Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learning time with chatting with AI. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot can be a great help in coding! Try them, many coders do it. Maybe the GitHub Copilot is stil free to use for students and teachers who join GitHub Education), they can be integrated in your programming IDE like RStudio and VSCode. Copilots can speed up writing. However, they may deliver bad code. There is no way around understanding yourself what code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! AI chatbots and Copilots can also help you to understand code. Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look. They rarely deliver the complete code. Expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong! You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot! When a task in a Homework project can be well solved by Copilot we are happy if you drop us a note, same when it is totally off, it is interesting to explore what AI can do well and what not.\nHave a draft text snippet written. I do not recommend to use AI for writing. Writing is to a large extent thinking and this is important. It is not “forbidden” to use AI for writing. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! With text generated purely by chatbots, it is often evident for us that students do not understand. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible self-written text. Text written by chatbots is often very generic and not specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Generic text is considered worse than specific self-written text.\n\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work.",

    "text": "Details\nYou need a GitHub account and become member of the GitHub Organization: CU-F25-MDSSB-01-Concepts-Tools of the course. Follow the instructions on the linked page of the organization. - You need a computer with Windows, MacOS, or Linux (maybe also other exotic operating systems). A tablet, phone or Chromebook is probably not sufficient. - You need to install software on your computer. Here is what you need including links where to download and find instructions for you operating system: - Statistical Programming Language: R, later we will alos use python. Instructions will come in class. - Version Control System: Git - Integrated Development Environments (IDE): The instructors uses positron. All instructions will be based on this. In the past the instructors used RStudio. Positron is developed by the same people and is somehow its modern version.\nWhen R, Git, positron are installed, open positron and test that everything works together:\n\nIs R running? On the top right you should see the R-symbol and its version numbers. That should be your current session. If not click on it, maybe it lists a python session or Start Session. Then a Select Interpreter Session dialog should pop up and you can start a new one and find R. If R is not offered solve this first by finding out how Positron can find the R installation. Usually it is detected automatically.\nAnother check: Go the CONSOLE tab (usually at the bottom). Scroll to the beginning. It should start with something like R 4.5.1 started. At the end of the console you should see a &gt;-prompt. Type version and hit ENTER. You should see the version of printed.\nDo you have access to the tidyverse? In R, you will use packages in the package family tidyverse. You can install it by running install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in the CONSOLE.\nDo git and quarto run from the TERMINAL? Go to the TERMINAL tab besides the CONSOLE. Type git --version and hit ENTER. You should see the version of git printed. Then type quarto --version and hit ENTER. You should see the version of quarto printed.\nNote: You can also write R and hit ENTER. You start an R session in the Terminal. We do not need it, so type q() and ENTER to leave R again. (No need to save the workspace, just hit ENTER again if asked.)\n\nLearning: Understand the difference between the CONSOLE and the TERMINAL! Both are command line interfaces (CLI).\n\nThe CONSOLE is for R commands in the current session in positron.\nThe TERMINAL is for system commands. It is also called SHELL (or also Console …, but that is confusing here). It also works outside of positron. You can control your whole computer using the TERMINAL. It does not start with a simple &gt; but first with a name of your machine and then with the current working directory. Working directory means where in your file system the computer will operate your next command. We the command line tools mainly for git and quarto. For both we will also use short cuts and convenient click and point interfaces in positron. But it is important to understand what happens in the background and that you can always use the TERMINAL directly for all the things of git and quarto.",

Often they are informative or even tell you what to do! (Hint: Uninformative error messages are also common. Maybe you get at least a hint where the problem lies. You will become more advanced on this, error messages which are not helpful now may become helpful in the future.)\nDo the homework before the next Data Science Tools Session and prepare questions to ask in class.",

If you do, please do first: Document and describe where you get stuck as precise as possible. Try to find out why as much as possible. Use Teams chat (or email)!",

    "text": "4 Problems with the git-GitHub-dance\nHappy Git with R is a great resource for helping you practically and for learning the version control concepts better. The site is well suited for our purpose of data science! Git was developed for software development and a lot of the advice and good practices you find by searching the internet are targeted for software engineering. Whenever you consult Happy Git with R for solutions for a problem, try to learn a bit about the basics. Git is not something to learn in one course but step by step while doing.\nProblems with getting started are likely related to the installation of software and connecting git and GitHub. Reading in Sections 4 - 14.\n\nAfter installing git, you need to Introduce yourself to Git (Use the email associated with your GitHub account.)\nThen you have to make the communication with GitHub possible as outlined by the introduction Can you here me now?. The default is to communicate via HTTPS (instead of SSH).\n\nIn the past you could authenticate via your GitHub-user password, now you need a personal access token which is something like a password created by GitHub which you can see and copy only once. (No worries, if loose the connection you can create a new one.)\nThese are the instructions for Personal access token for HTTPS. Ideally it works following the instructions in “TL;DR”. (Install the packages usethis and gitcreds in R.)\nNow, you should be able to clone the Homework repos analog to Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub.\nSometimes you have git installed but RStudio does not find it. Usually it works out of the box. If not, read Detect Git from RStudio\nFinally there is a page for problems which appear sometimes which you can scroll through looking if it is related to your problem: https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting\n\n\nFor problems appearing after your first successful git-GitHub-dance operations helpful sections are for example:\n\nYou want to bring your new versions to GitHub but when you push it does not work: Dealing with push rejection\nYou need to pull (to synchronize remote and local) but you made changes locally and get warnings: Pull, but you have local work\nIf you can not properly push and pull anymore and there are conflicts all over the place: Consider Burn it all down (Meaning to start again by cloning again …)",
