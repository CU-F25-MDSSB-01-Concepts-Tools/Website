    "text": "4 Problems with the git-GitHub-dance\nHappy Git with R is a great resource for helping you practically and for learning the version control concepts better. The site is well suited for our purpose of data science! Git was developed for software development and a lot of the advice and good practices you find by searching the internet are targeted for software engineering. Whenever you consult Happy Git with R for solutions for a problem, try to learn a bit about the basics. Git is not something to learn in one course but step by step while doing.\nProblems with getting started are likely related to the installation of software and connecting git and GitHub. Reading in Sections 4 - 14.\n\nAfter installing git, you need to Introduce yourself to Git (Use the email associated with your GitHub account.)\nThen you have to make the communication with GitHub possible as outlined by the introduction Can you here me now?. The default is to communicate via HTTPS (instead of SSH).\n\nIn the past you could authenticate via your GitHub-user password, now you need a personal access token which is something like a password created by GitHub which you can see and copy only once. (No worries, if loose the connection you can create a new one.)\nThese are the instructions for Personal access token for HTTPS. Ideally it works following the instructions in “TL;DR”. (Install the packages usethis and gitcreds in R.)\nNow, you should be able to clone the Homework repos analog to Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub.\nSometimes you have git installed but RStudio does not find it. Usually it works out of the box. If not, read Detect Git from RStudio\nFinally there is a page for problems which appear sometimes which you can scroll through looking if it is related to your problem: https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting\n\n\nFor problems appearing after your first successful git-GitHub-dance operations helpful sections are for example:\n\nYou want to bring your new versions to GitHub but when you push it does not work: Dealing with push rejection\nYou need to pull (to synchronize remote and local) but you made changes locally and get warnings: Pull, but you have local work\nIf you can not properly push and pull anymore and there are conflicts all over the place: Consider Burn it all down (Meaning to start again by cloning again …)",

AI chatbots can be helpful to explain you concepts on your desired level and get a feeling about how topics are treated. You can ask for an easier or more detailed explanation or focus on certain aspects. Note: The capabilities are limited and you likely receive also false information! An AI chat can be a good entry point to learn about a specific topic but the more specific it gets the more likely it is that AI will start to deliver useless or wrong answers. Using chatbots should remain a small part of your learning process. Rule of thumb: Spend not more than 25% of the learning time with chatting with AI. There is no way around reading textbooks, reading software documentation, learning and understanding concepts, searching for help online, asking instructors or fellow students.\nHave code snippets written. Tools like GitHub Copilot can be a great help in coding! Try them, many coders do it. Maybe the GitHub Copilot is stil free to use for students and teachers who join GitHub Education), they can be integrated in your programming IDE like RStudio and VSCode. Copilots can speed up writing. However, they may deliver bad code. There is no way around understanding yourself what code is doing! Do not spend endless hours asking for new code with new prompts, spend time understanding a language and the functions and objects you are using! AI chatbots and Copilots can also help you to understand code. Copilots can be a great help to get a skeleton of code and an idea how your solution might look. They rarely deliver the complete code. Expect that the code does not work, expect that the code seems to works but the results are wrong! You are 100% accountable for the code you produce, with or without the help of a copilot! When a task in a Homework project can be well solved by Copilot we are happy if you drop us a note, same when it is totally off, it is interesting to explore what AI can do well and what not.\nHave a draft text snippet written. I do not recommend to use AI for writing. Writing is to a large extent thinking and this is important. It is not “forbidden” to use AI for writing. However, you are 100% accountable for the text you deliver. You are expected to know what your text is about and to be able to answer questions about what your text means! With text generated purely by chatbots, it is often evident for us that students do not understand. We consider such cases worse than incomplete but sensible self-written text. Text written by chatbots is often very generic and not specific. In general, we value more specific text higher than generic text. Generic text is considered worse than specific self-written text.\n\nNote: Philosophical and legal questions around the training and use of chatbots and code copilots are controversially contested and re-examined constantly! We encourage to engage with such questions and become aware of arguments and debates.\nIf any part of this AI policy is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to us for a conversation before submitting your work.",

If you do not manage, ask for help.\nConflicts in the team. Please communicate about tensions in your team and try to solve them. However, you are not obliged to finish your project as a dysfunctional team.
