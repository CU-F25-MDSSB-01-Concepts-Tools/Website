A note on synthetic data sets\n2. Timeline to finish the semester\n3. Course Goals\n4. Mock Exam\n5. Students evaluation of teaching (SET)\n\n\n## Synthetic data sets {.smaller}\n\n- **Synthetic data sets** are data sets that are generated by a computer program\n- They are used to test algorithms and to illustrate concepts\n- They are also used to **protect privacy of real data sets**\n\n**For data science project:**\n\n- Better use real data\n- From synthetic data it is very hard to learn about the real world\n- Interpretation of results with respect to the real world is very limited\n- Theoretical insights are often very generic\n\n## Timeline to finish the semester {.smaller }\n\n- Today: **Monday, Dec 4**\n- **Thursday, Final Tools Session:** Work-in-progress presentation of your Data Science Projects\n- **This week:** Feedback on Homework repositories shall be prepares by instructors. \n- **By Sunday, Dec 10:** Write your questions on the achievements of the course for the exam to me (Email or Teams).\n- **Monday, Dec 11:** I will answer your questions in the organization repo. \n- **Friday Dec 15:** Receive final information on the exam by email or Teams.  Project\n- **Saturday, Dec 16, 9:00-11:00:** Final exam\n- **Friday, Dec 22:** Push your final commits for the Data Science Project\n\n\n## Course Goals  {.smaller}\n\n1. Enable you to **do data analysis projects** on your own\n2. Enable you to **learn on your own**\n    - analysis concepts \n    - programming tools\n    - being aware of relevant domain knowledge\n    - communicate your results in reproducible reports\n    \n## Next courses with me  {.smaller}\n\n**Spring 2024**\n\n- Data Science Lab\n- Introduction to Computational Social Science\n\n**Fall 2024**\n\n- Visual Communication and Data Storytelling\n\n## Mock Exam  {.smaller}\n\n- Discuss questions in groups of 2-3 students\n- Question round\n\n\n## Students evaluation of teaching (SET)\n\n- Fill out the survey for this course (you have received access by email)\n   - It is anonymous, we will not see personalized evaluations\n- We, the instructors, are very interested to read your feedback\n   - All 3 instructors will share the feedback\n",
