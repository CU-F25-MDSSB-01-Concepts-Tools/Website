## Preliminaries {.smaller}

In this lectures we will use these packages. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

The datasets used can be downloaded from:   
<https://github.com/CU-F25-MDSSB-01-Concepts-Tools/Website/tree/main/lectures>


# Strings and Special Values

## String modification {.smaller}

We modify strings with the [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package from the tidyverse core. 
All functions from `stringr` start with `str_`. 

Very few examples:

```{r}
#| echo: true
c("x", "y")
str_c("x", "y")
```

. . . 

```{r}
#| echo: true
str_c("x", "y", "z", sep = ",")
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
length(c("x", "y", "z"))
str_length(c("x", "y", "z"))
str_length(c("This is a string.", "z"))
```


## String wrangling with variable names {.smaller}

This is a typical use case. We have data like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
data <- tibble(
  Name = c("A", "B", "C"),
  Age_2020 = c(20, 30, 40),
  Age_2021 = c(21, 31, 41),
  Age_2022 = c(22, 32, 42)
)
data
```

We tidy that data set by creating a year variable.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
data |>
  pivot_longer(
    c("Age_2020", "Age_2021", "Age_2022"),
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "Age"
  )
```

. . . 

OK, but the year variable is a string but we want numbers.

## Use `word` {.smaller}

`word` extracts words from a sentence. 

- You can specify the words from  `start` to `end`. Use numbers or negative numbers to count from the last word. 
- The word separator need not be `" "` but can be any character.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
word("This is a string.", start = 2, end = -2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
word("Age_2022", start = 2, sep = "_")
```

. . .

It also works vectorized. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
data |>
  pivot_longer(
    c("Age_2020", "Age_2021", "Age_2022"),
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "Age"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    Year = word(Year, start = 2, sep = "_") |> 
      as.numeric()
      )
```


## String Detection / Regular Expressions {.smaller}

Many `stringr` function follow the structure `(string, pattern)`.  
`string` is  in our data, `pattern` is a string interpreted as a [**Regular Expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

A few examples show its power:

```{r}
#| echo: true
fruits <- c("apple", "pineapple", "Pear", "orange", "peach", "banana")
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
str_detect(fruits, "apple")
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
str_extract(fruits, "apple")
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
str_extract(fruits, "[Pp][a-z]")
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
str_extract(fruits, "^[Pp][a-z]")
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
str_extract(fruits, "^[Pp][a-z]{3}")
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
str_extract(fruits, "^[Pp][a-z]+")
```

Test other words, like `str_extract("Pizza Napoli","^[Pp][a-z]+")`: 

```{webr-r}


```

## Regular Expressions {.smaller}

**Regular expressions** (*regexp* or *regex*): Character-Sequences specifying *match patterns*. 

- Useful when strings contain unstructured or semi-structured data. 

- When you first look at a regexp, you'll think a cat walked across your keyboard, but as your understanding improves they will start to make sense. (Or you ask an AI chatbot to give you what you need 🙂)

**Guess what this regexp's are to match?**

``"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"``  
``"^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$"``  
``"^[[:alnum:].-_]+@[[:alnum:].-]+$"``

```{webr-r}

```

. . . 

Email addresses! However, this is not the perfect solution. Dig deeper: Read the discussion and see the example in [How can I validate an email address using a regular expression?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201323/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-using-a-regular-expression) at stackoverflow. 


# Special Values for "no data"

## Special values  {.smaller}

You should know the differences of special values. 

- `NA`: Not available (string, number, or whatever vector entry)
- `NULL`: Null object, the undefined object, e.g. an empty list or an empty list element
- `NaN`: For numbers: Meaning "Not a Number" (when math cannot solve what you want)
- `Inf`: For numbers: Positive infinity 
- `-Inf`: For numbers: Negative infinity

Check some math:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
1 / 0
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
-1 / 0
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
0 / 0
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
1 / 0 + 1 / 0
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
1 / 0 - 1 / 0
```

## `NA`s  {.smaller}

`NaN` is *not* a number, but `NA` stands for genuinely unknown values.   
It can also be in a character of logical vector.

```{r}
#| echo: true
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(x)
```

. . .

The type of `NA` is logical. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
typeof(NA)
typeof(NaN)
```

Does it make sense? Let us look at `NA`'s in logical operations. 

## `NA`s in logical operations

`NA` can be TRUE or FALSE. 

Usually operations including `NA` results again in `NA`, but some not!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
NA & TRUE
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
NA | TRUE
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
NA & FALSE
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
NA | FALSE
```

Understanding logical operations is important!


## `NULL` is the null object {.smaller}

- used to represent lists with zero length

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- 1:10
attributes(x)
```

- used as a placeholder for missing values in lists and dataframes

```{r}
#| echo: true
L <- list(a = 1)
L[[3]] <- 5
L
```

# Relational Data - Joining

## Working with more dataframes {.smaller}

- Data can be distributed in several dataframes which have relations which each other. 
- For example, they share variables as the five dataframes in `nycflights13`.

![](img/nycflights13_data.png){height=300}

:::{.aside}
Often variables in different dataframe have the same name, but that need not be the case! See the variable `faa` in `airports` matches `origin` and `dest` in `flights`.

## Joining dataframes {.smaller}

`something_join(x, y)`^[The notion *join* comes from SQL database. In other data manipulation frameworks joining is called *merging*.] for dataframes `x` and `y` which have a *relation*

- `left_join()`: all rows from x must remain
- `right_join()`: all rows from y must remain
- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y must remain
- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y remain
- ... (more exist see [`dplyr` cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf))

## Keys {.smaller}

- A **key** is a variable or a set of variables which uniquely identifies observations
- What was the key in the dataframe of women in science? [`name`]{.fragment}

. . . 

Switching back to `nycflights13` as example

- In simple cases, a single variable is sufficient to identify an observation, e.g. each plane in `planes` is identified by `tailnum`.
- Sometimes, multiple variables are needed; e.g. to identify an observation in
`weather` you need five variables: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin`

## How to check if a variable is a key? {.smaller .scrollable}

Counting observation and filter those more than one

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(nycflights13)
planes |> count(tailnum) |> filter(n > 1)
weather |> count(year, month, day, hour, origin) |> filter(n > 1)
```

OK, here 3 observations are twice, one for each airport. Probably this is related to [Daylight saving time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) in the US. In Fall clocks are turned back 1 hour. So this hour appears twice. 

. . . 

Example: Without hour it is not a key

```{r}
#| echo: true
weather |> count(year, month, day, origin) |> filter(n > 1)
```

Why do we have only 22 and 23 on day 1 of month 1? No idea. Dig deeper yourself!

## Primary and foreign keys  {.smaller}

- A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. E.g,
`planes$tailnum` in `planes`. 
- A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another dataframe E.g.
`flights$tailnum` is a foreign key in `flights` because it matches each flight to a unique plane in `planes`.

- A primary key and a foreign key form a relation. 
    - Often a *1-to-many* relation. Each plane has many flights. 
        - Implication: Joining `flights` with `planes` duplicates the rows of `planes` for each flight of that plane.
- Relations can also be many-to-many. Airlines can fly to many airports; airport can host many airplanes.


## Joining when key names differ? {.smaller .scrollable}

We have to specify the key relation with a named vector in the `by` argument. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
dim(flights)
flights |> left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```

The alternative (new default) version is to use the `join_by` function using the comparison sign `==`. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
flights |> left_join(airports, join_by("dest" == "faa"))
```

**Why does the number of rows stays the same after joining?**

. . .

`faa` is a primary key in `airports`. It is matched with `dest` as the foreign key in `flights`. 



## `left_join` is *essentially* `right_join` with switched dataframes {.smaller .scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true
airports_right_flights <- airports |>
  right_join(flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))
airports_right_flights
```

Differences 

- In a join where keys have different column names the name of the first dataframe survives (unless you use `keep = TRUE`). Here, `faa` survived instead of `dest`
- The columns from the first dataframe come first
- The order of rows is taken from the first dataframe, while duplication and dropping of variables is determined by the second dataframe (because it is a `right_join`)

Using the fact that flights seem to be ordered by `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time` we can re-arrange:

```{r}
#| echo: true
airports_right_flights |>
  rename(dest = faa) |>
  select(names(flights)) |> # Use order of flights
  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time)
```

Note of caution: A deeper analysis shows that the order is still not exactly the same. 

## `left_join` with reversed dataframes {.smaller .scrollable}

Let us do this test to understand joins better

```{r}
#| echo: true
dim(airports)
dim(flights)
airports |>
  left_join(flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))
```

We have much more rows in than in airports. However, we have less rows than when we `flight |> left_join(airports)`. Why? 

**Why does the number of rows changes after joining?**

. . . 

`dest` is not a primary key in `flights`. There are more flights with the same destination so rows of `airports` get duplicated.  

**Why is the number of rows then less than the number of rows in flights?**

. . .

`r nrow(flights)` flights and `r airports |> left_join(flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) |> nrow()` airports left joined by flights. 

Let us do some checks:

```{r}
#| echo: true
length(unique(airports$faa)) # Unique turns out to be redundant because faa is a primary key
length(unique(flights$dest))
```

There are much more airports then destinations in flights!  
... but the rows of airports prevail when it is the first in a `left_join`.  
So, the dataframe should even *increase* because we get several rows of airports without flights.  

. . .

Let us dig deeper.

```{r}
#| echo: true
setdiff(unique(airports$faa), unique(flights$dest)) |> length()

setdiff(unique(flights$dest), unique(airports$faa)) |> length()
```

1,357 airports have no flights!   
There are four destinations in flights, which are not in the airports list!

How many flights are to these?

```{r}
#| echo: true
flights |>
  filter(dest %in% setdiff(unique(flights$dest), unique(airports$faa))) |>
  nrow()
```

7,602 flights go to destinations not listed as airport

```{r}
#| echo: true
nrow(airports |> left_join(flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))) ==
  nrow(flights) + 1357 - 7602
```

OK, now we have a clear picture: 

`airport` with left_joined `flights` duplicates the rows of `airports` for each flight flying to it. So the total number of rows is

- the number of flights 
- plus the number of airport which do not appear as a destination
- minus the flights which go to destinations which are not listed in airports


**Learning:** The new number of observation after a join can be a complex combination of duplication and dropping.   
It is your responsibility to understand what is happening!








# Math: Sets and vectors

## Definition: Sets and vectors {background-color="aquamarine"}

A **set** is mathematical model for the *unordered* collection of *different* things (**elements**).

Examples

- $\{3, \text{Hi}, 😀, 🖖 \}$
- $\{1,3,5\}$
- The natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ (infinite!)
- $\{\mathtt{"EWR"}, \mathtt{"LGA"}, \mathtt{"JFK"}\}$   
these are `origin` airports in `flights`


## Math: Sets and vectors {background-color="aquamarine"}

A **vector** is an ordered collection of things (**components**) of the same type. 

In a set, each thing can only be once and the order does not matter!

. . .

$\{1,3,5\} = \{3,5,1\} = \{1,1,1,3,5,5\}$

For vectors:

$[1\ 3\ 5] \neq [3\ 5\ 1]$ because we compare component-wise, so we cannot even compare with those with the vector $[1\ 1\ 1\ 3\ 5\ 5]$

## Math: Set operations  {background-color="aquamarine"}

Sets $A = \{🐺, 🦊, 🐶\}$ and $B = \{🐶, 🐷, 🐹\}$, $C = \{🐶, 🐷\}$:

::: {.incremental}
- Set **union** $A \cup B$ = \{🐺, 🦊, 🐶, 🐷, 🐹\}    
  $x \in A \cup B$ when $x \in A$ `|` (or) $x\in B$
- Set **intersection** $A \cap B$ = \{🐶\}    
  $x \in A \cap B$ when $x \in A$ `&` (and) $x\in B$
- Set **difference** $A \setminus B = \{🐺, 🦊\}$, $B \setminus A$ = \{🐷, 🐹\}
- **Subset**: $C \subset B$ but $C \not\subset A$
:::

. . . 

See the analogy of set operations and logical operations. 

## Set operations in R {.smaller}

`unique` shows the set of elements in a vector

```{r}
#| echo: true
unique(flights$origin)
```

. . . 

`setequal` tests for set equality

```{r}
#| echo: true
setequal(c("EWR", "LGA", "JFK"), c("EWR", "EWR", "LGA", "JFK"))
```

. . . 

`union`, `intersect`, `setdiff` treat vectors as sets and operate as expected

```{r}
#| echo: true
union(1:5, 3:7)
intersect(1:5, 3:7)
setdiff(1:5, 3:7)
```

Relations to `joins`: `full_join()` is like the *union*, `inner_join()` is like the *intersection*.

## Sets: Take-away

- Set operations are not a daily business in data science
- However, they are useful for data exploration!
- Knowing set operations is key to understand **probability**:
    - A *sample space* is the *set of all atomic events*. 
    - An *event* is a *subset of the sample space* 
    - A *probability function* assigns probabilities to all events. 


# Math: Functions

## Functions mathematically  {background-color="aquamarine"}

Consider two sets: The *domain* $X$ and the *codomain* $Y$. 

A *function* $f$ assigns each element of $X$ to exactly one element of $Y$.

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
We write $f : X \to  Y$  
["$f$ maps from $X$ to $Y$"]{style="color:blue;"}

and $x \mapsto f(x)$   
["$x$ maps to $f(x)$"]{style="color:blue;"}

The yellow set is called the *image* of $f$.

# Functions: Graphs, Shift and Scale, Polynomial vs. Exponential

## Graphs of functions   {.smaller background-color="aquamarine"}

- A function is characterized by the set all possible pairs $(x,f(x))$. 
- This is called its *graph*. 
- When domain and codomain are real numbers then the graph can be shown in a *Cartesian coordinate system*. Example $f(x) = x^3 - x^2$

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) x^3 - x^2) +
  xlim(c(-0.5, 1.5)) +
  xlab("x") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```

<!-- ## Higher dimensional input and output -->

<!-- Function can take $m$-dimensional input vectors and $n$-dimensional output vectors $f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$.  -->

## Shifts and scales {.smaller background-color="aquamarine" .scrollable}

How can we shift, stretch, or shrink a graph vertically and horizontally?

. . . 

:::{.panel-tabset}

### $y$-shift
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
Add a constant to the function. 

$f(x) = x^3 - x^2 \leadsto$

$\quad f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + a$

For $a =$ [-2]{style="color:red;"}, [-0.5]{style="color:darkred;"}, [0.5]{style="color:darkblue;"}, [2]{style="color:blue;"}

### $x$-shift
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
**Subtract** a constant from all $x$ within the function definition.

$f(x) = x^3 - x^2 \leadsto$

$\quad f(x) = (x - a)^3 - (x - a)^2$

For $a =$ [-2]{style="color:red;"}, [-0.5]{style="color:darkred;"}, [0.5]{style="color:darkblue;"}, [2]{style="color:blue;"}

**Attention:**  
Shifting $a$ units to the right needs subtracting $a$!   
You can think of the *coordinate system being shifted* in direction $a$ while the graph stays.

## Math: Polynomials and exponentials {.smaller background-color="aquamarine"}

A *polynomial* is a function which is composed of (many) addends of the form $ax^n$ for different values of $a$ and $n$. 

In an *exponential* the $x$ appears in the exponent. $f(x) = x^2$ vs. [$f(x) = 2^x$]{style="color:red;"}

# Functions in Programming and Programming Functions

## Input $\to$ output {.smaller} 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg)

- Metaphorically, a function is a *machine* or a *blackbox* that for each input yields an output. 
- The inputs of a function are also called **arguments**. 

. . . 

Difference to math terminolgy:   
**The output need not be the same for the same input.**

## Function as objects in R {.scrollable .smaller}
 
`function` is a class of an object in R

```{r}
#| echo: true
class(c)
class(ggplot2::ggplot)
```

Calling the function without brackets writes its code or some information. 
```{r}
#| echo: true
sd # This function is written in R, and we see its code
c # This function is not written in R but is a R primitive
ggplot2::ggplot # This function is not written solely in R
```

## Define your own functions! (in R) {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
add_one <- function(x) {
  x + 1
}
# Test it
add_one(10)
```

The skeleton for a function definition is

```R
function_name <- function(input){
  # do something with the input(s)
  # return something as output
}
```

- `function_name` should be a short but evocative verb. 
- The `input` can be empty or one or more `name` or `name=expression` terms as arguments.
- The last evaluated expression is returned as output. 
- When the body or the function is only one line `{}` can be omitted. For example   
`add_one <- function(x) x + 1`


## Flexibility of inputs and outputs {.smaller}

- Arguments can be specified by `name=expression` or just `expression` (then they are taken as the next argument)
- Default values for arguments can be provided. Useful when an argument is a parameter. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
mymult <- function(x = 2, y = 3) x * (y - 1)
mymult(3, 4)
```


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
mymult()
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
mymult(y = 3, x = 6)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
mymult(5)
```
 
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
mymult(y = 2)
```

. . . 

For complex output use a list

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column-fragment
mymult <- function(x = 2, y = 3) {
  list(out1 = x * (y - 1), out2 = x * (y - 2))
}
mymult()
```

# Think and program vectorized!

## Vectorized functions {.smaller}

Mathematical functions in programming are often "vectorized": 

- Operations on a single value are applied to each component of the vector. 
- Operations on two values are applied "component-wise" (for vectors of the same length)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
log10(c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000))
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
c(1, 1, 2) + c(3, 1, 0)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
(0:5)^2
```

## Recall: Vector creation functions

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
1:10
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
seq(from = -0.5, to = 1.5, by = 0.1)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 10)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
rep(1:3, times = 3)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
rep(1:3, each = 3)
```

## Plotting and transformation {.smaller}

**Vector creation and vectorized functions** are key for plotting and transformation. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
func <- function(x) x^3 - x^2 # Create a vectorized function
data <- tibble(x = seq(-0.5, 1.5, by = 0.01)) |> # Vector creation
  mutate(y = func(x)) # Vectorized transformation using the function
data |> ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```

## Conveniently `ggplot`ing functions

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.height: 3
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = log) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 3 * x - 4, color = "red") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```


Code line 3 shows another important concept: **anonymous functions**. The function `function(x) 3*x - 4` is defined *on the fly* without a name.


# Conditional Statements (`if`) and Iteration (`map`)

## Conditional statements  {.smaller}

- `if` executes a code block if a condition is `TRUE`
- `else` executes a code block if the condition is `FALSE`

Skeleton

```R
if (condition) {
  # code block
} else {
  # code block
}
```

Example: A piece-wise defined function

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{r}
#| echo: true

piecewise <- function(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    0.5 * x
  } else {
    x - 1
  }
}
```

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{r}
#| echo: true
piecewise(1)
piecewise(2)
piecewise(3)
```

:::

::::

. . . 

Problem: `piecewise` is not vectorized. `piecewise(c(1,2,3))` does not work!

## Vectorized operations with `map` {.smaller}

- `map` functions apply a function to each element of a vector.^[In `tidyverse` they are provided in the package `purrr`]
- `map(.x, .f, ...)` applies the function `.f` to each element of the vector of `.x` and returns a *list*.
- `map_dbl` returns a double *vector* (other variants exist)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
```{r}
#| echo: true

map(c(1, 2, 3), piecewise)
map_dbl(c(1, 2, 3), piecewise)

piecewise_vectorized <-
  function(x) map_dbl(x, piecewise)
```

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{r}
#| echo: true
piecewise_vectorized(seq(0, 3, by = 0.5))
tibble(x = seq(0, 3, by = 0.5)) |>
  mutate(y = piecewise_vectorized(x)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```

:::

::::

## `reduce` {.smaller}

Instead of a list or a vector `reduce` returns a single value.   
To that end it needs a function with two arguments. It applies it to the first two elements of the vector, then to the result and the third element, then the result and the fourth element, and so on.

```{r}
#| echo: true
1:10 |> reduce(\(x, y) x + y)
```

Note: `\(x)` is a short way to write an **anonymous function** as `function(x)`. 

. . . 

Example: Reading multiple files

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
Instead of 

```R
a <-read_csv("a.csv")
b <-read_csv("b.csv")
c <-read_csv("c.csv")
d <-read_csv("d.csv")
e <-read_csv("e.csv")
f <-read_csv("f.csv")
g <-read_csv("g.csv")

bind_rows(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)
```

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
Write

```R
letter[1:7] |> 
 map(\(x) read_csv(paste0(x,".csv"))) |> 
 reduce(bind_rows)
```

:::

::::

## `map` and `reduce` {.smaller}

- `map` applies a function to each element of a vector (or list) and returns a list (or vector if `map_dbl` or other vaeriants are used)
    - The output has the same `length` as the input
- `reduce` applies a function taking two arguments and then summarizes the list by applying them two element 1 and 2 and then again the result with element 3 and then the result with element 4, ...
    - The output is one object
    
- Remark: The problem of vectorizing a function which has an `if` and `else` statement (see the example `piecewise_vectorized`) can also be solved using the vectorized version of it:    
`if_else(condition = *condition*, true = *value-if_TRUE*, false = *value-if_FALSE*)`    
Here every argument can be a vector!


## Function programming: Take away

- Functions are the most important building blocks of programming.
- Functions can and often should be vectorized.
- Vectorized functions are the basis for plotting and transformation.
- `map` functions are powerful tools for iterative tasks!    
    *Expect to not get the idea first but to love them later.*
