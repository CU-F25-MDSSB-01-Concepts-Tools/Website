# Hypothesis testing
Large part of the content adapted from <http://datasciencebox.org>.


## Organ donors {.smaller}

**Background story:** People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special "medical consultant". These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients. 

. . . 

**Example track record:** One consultant tried to attract patients by noting that the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).

. . . 

[Is this strong evidence for a good track record?]{style='color:red;'}

## Data {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
organ_donor <- tibble(
  outcome = c(rep("complication", 3), rep("no complication", 59))
)
```

```{r }
#| echo: true
organ_donor |>
  count(outcome)
```


## Parameter vs. statistic {.smaller}

A **parameter** for a hypothesis test is the "true" value of interest. We typically estimate the parameter using a **sample statistic** as a **point estimate**.

$q$: true rate of complication, here 0.1 (10% complication rate in US)

$\hat{q}$: rate of complication in the sample = $\frac{3}{62}$ = 
`r round(3/62, 3)` (This is the point estimate.)


## Correlation vs. causation  {.smaller}

**Is it possible to infer the consultant's claim using the data?**

No. The claim is: *There is a causal connection*. However, the data are observational.
For example, maybe patients who can afford a medical consultant can afford better medical care, which can also lead to a lower complication rate (for example).

. . .

**What is possible?**

While it is not possible to assess the causal claim, it is still possible to test for an association using these data. For this question we ask, **could the low complication rate of $\hat{q}$ = `r round(3/62, 3)` be due to chance?**



## Two claims

- [**Null hypothesis $H_0$:**]{style='color:blue;'} "There is nothing going on"

Complication rate for this consultant is no different than the US average of 10%

- [**Alternative hypothesis $H_1$:**]{style='color:blue;'} "There is something going on"

Complication rate for this consultant is **lower** than the US average of 10%


## Understand hypothesis testing as a court trial {.smaller}

- **Null hypothesis**, $H_0$: Defendant is innocent
- **Alternative hypothesis**, $H_A$: Defendant is guilty


- **Present the evidence:** Collect data

- **Judge the evidence:** "Could these data plausibly have happened by chance if the null hypothesis were true?"
    * Yes: Fail to reject $H_0$
    * No: Reject $H_0$
    

## Hypothesis testing framework {.smaller}

- Start with a null hypothesis, $H_0$, that represents the status quo

- Set an alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, that represents the research question, i.e. what we are testing for

- Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and calculate a **p-value**.    
**Definition p-value:** *Probability of observed or more extreme outcome given that the null hypothesis is true.*
    - if the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, stick with the null hypothesis
    - if they do, then reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative


## Setting the hypotheses {.smaller}

Which of the following is the correct set of hypotheses for the claim that the consultant has lower complication rates?

(a) $H_0: q = 0.10$; $H_A: q \ne 0.10$ 

(b) $H_0: q = 0.10$; $H_A: q > 0.10$ 

(c) $H_0: q = 0.10$; $H_A: q < 0.10$ 

(d) $H_0: \hat{q} = 0.10$; $H_A: \hat{q} \ne 0.10$ 

(e) $H_0: \hat{q} = 0.10$; $H_A: \hat{q} > 0.10$ 

(f) $H_0: \hat{q} = 0.10$; $H_A: \hat{q} < 0.10$ 

. . . 

(c) is correct.   
Hypotheses are about the true rate of complication $q$ not the observed ones $\hat{q}$


# Simulation for Hypothesis Testing

## Simulating the null distribution {.smaller}

Since $H_0: q = 0.10$, we need to simulate a null distribution where the probability of success (complication) for each trial (patient) is 0.10.

**How should we simulate the null distribution for this study using a bag of chips?**

- How many chips? [For example 10 which makes 10% choices possible]{.fragment style='color:red;'}
- How many colors? [2]{.fragment style='color:red;'}
- What should colors represent? ["complication", "no complication"]{.fragment style='color:red;'}
- How many draws?  [62 as the data]{.fragment style='color:red;'}
- With replacement or without replacement? [With replacement]{.fragment style='color:red;'}

When sampling from the null distribution, what would be the expected proportion of "complications"?  [0.1]{.fragment  style='color:red;'}


## Simulation! {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
set.seed(1234) # The seed is set for the sake of stable presentation outcomes.
outcomes <- c("complication", "no complication")
sim1 <- sample(outcomes, size = 62, prob = c(0.1, 0.9), replace = TRUE)
sim1
sum(sim1 == "complication")/62
```

Oh OK, this was exactly the consultant's rate. But maybe it was a rare event? Let us repeat it. 

## More simulation! {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
one_sim <- function() sample(outcomes, size = 62, prob = c(0.1, 0.9), replace = TRUE)

sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
sum(one_sim() == "complication")/62
```


## Automating with `tidymodels`^[Of course, you can also do it in your own way without packages.] {.smaller}

## Visualizing the null distribution {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution")
```


# p-value

## Calculating the p-value, visually {.smaller}

**What is the p-value:** *How often was the simulated sample proportion at least as extreme as the observed sample proportion?*^[This a one-sided hypothesis test because we are looking for extremely lower rates not also extremely higher rates. We do one-sided test if we know the direction of interest, here "low" and "lower" rates.]

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig.height: 3
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution")  +
 geom_vline(xintercept = 3/62, color = "red")
```


## Calculating the p-value, directly

```{r}
#| echo: true
null_dist |>
 summarise(p_value = sum(stat <= 3/62)/n())
```

This is the fraction of simulations where complications was equal or below `r 3/62`. 


## Significance level  {.smaller}

- A **significance level** $\alpha$ is a threshold we make up to make our judgment about the plausibility of the null hypothesis being true given the observed data. 

- We often use $\alpha = 0.05 = 5\%$ as the cutoff for whether the p-value is low enough that the data are unlikely to have come from the null model. 

- If p-value < $\alpha$, reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$: The data provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis.

- If p-value > $\alpha$, fail to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$: The data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis.

**What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?**

Since the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
These data do not provide convincing evidence that this consultant incurs a lower complication rate than the 10% overall US complication rate.

## 100 simulations is not sufficient {.smaller}

- We simulate 15,000 times to get an accurate distribution.

```{r}
#| echo: true
null_dist <- organ_donor |>
  specify(response = outcome, success = "complication") |>
  hypothesize(null = "point", 
              p = c("complication" = 0.10, "no complication" = 0.90)) |> 
  generate(reps = 15000, type = "simulate") |> 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
ggplot(data = null_dist, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3/62, color = "red")
```


## Our more robust p-value 

For the null distribution with 15,000 simulations

```{r}
#| echo: true
null_dist |>
  filter(stat <= 3/62) |>
  summarise(p_value = n()/nrow(null_dist))
```

Oh OK, our first p-value was much more borderline in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

## p-value in model outputs {.smaller}

Model output for a linear model with palmer penguins.

```{r}
#| echo: true
linear_reg() |> set_engine("lm") |> 
	fit(bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm, data = penguins) |> tidy()
```

Model output for a logistic regression model with email from [openintro](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=email)

```{r}
#| echo: true
logistic_reg() |>  set_engine("glm") |>
  fit(spam ~ from + cc, data = email, family = "binomial") |> tidy()
```

What do the p-values mean? What is the null hypothesis?

. . .

**Null-Hypothesis:** There is no relationship between the predictor variable and the response variable, that means that the coefficient is equal to zero. 

**Smaller p-value** $\to$ more evidence for rejecting the hypothesis that there is no effect.

- Significance levels are fairly arbitrary. Sometimes they are used (wrongly) as definitive judgments
- They can even be used to do *p-hacking*: Searching for "significant" effects in observational data
- In parts of science it has become a "gamed" performance metric.
- The p-value says nothing about effect size!

## p-value misinterpretation {.smaller}

p-values do not measure^[From the American Statistical Association (ASA) 2016]

- the probability that the studied hypothesis is true
- the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone
- the size of an effect
- the "importance of a result" or "evidence regarding a model or hypothesis" (it is only against the null hypothesis).

. . .

Correct:   
The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.

p-values and significance tests, when properly applied and interpreted, increase the rigor of the conclusions drawn from data.^[From the American Statistical Association (ASA) 2019]



# Classification: Compare logistic regression and decision tree

## Purpose of the section {.smaller}

- Go again through the modeling workflow (with `tidymodels`) and see that large parts are identical
- Look again at the coefficients of a logistic regression model
- Learn the basic idea of a decision tree (you will not learn the details here)
- Do the classification with both models and compare the confusion matrices

## Specify recipe and models {.smaller}

For both logistic regression and decision tree:

```{r}
#| echo: true
peng_recipe <- recipe(sex ~ ., data = penguins) |> 
 step_rm(year)
```

. . .

- We specify a recipe to predict `sex` with all available variables in `penguins`
    - In typical model development, more pre-processing steps are done.

- What do the categorical predictors tell us? Which are signigficant?
- What do the numerical predictors tell us? Which are signigficant?
- Why is the coefficient for `body_mass_g` so small, but highly significant?
:::

::::
 
. . . 


**Categorical predictors:** We have 3 `species`, 3 `island`. So, we see
4 new variables, 2 for `species` and 2 for `island` (the third is the reference category). Species are significant (p < 0.05), but islands not.

**Numerical predictors:** `flipper_length_mm` is insignificant, though its coefficient is larger than for `body_mass_g`. Reason: values of `body_mass_g` are larger than those of `flipper_length_mm`. Body mass differs by much more grams than flipper length differs by millimeters. 


## What is a decision tree? {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
peng_tree_fit
```

- A sequence of rules for yes/no decisions
- Selects variables and thresholds which separate the data to predict (here `sex`) best 
- Further details are not the scope of this course


## Show rules {.smaller}

We "dig out" the original fitted `rpart`-object from the `workflow`-object with `peng_tree_fit$fit$fit$fit` and plot it:

```{r}
#| echo: true
rpart.rules(peng_tree_fit$fit$fit$fit, roundint=FALSE)
```

- The first three rules would predict `female` for all observations
- The last five rules would predict `male` for all observations

The order of `male` and `female` is because `sex` is a factor with the first level `female` and the second level `male`. The probabilities in front of the rule-text are for the second level: `male`.

## Visualize tree {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true
rpart.plot(peng_tree_fit$fit$fit$fit, 
           roundint=FALSE, tweak=1.5)
```

How to read?

- The percentage is the fraction of the total cases in this group
- The probability-number is the fraction of observations which are male in the group
- `male` of `female` and color would match the predicted outcome at this decision node

# Regression: Compare linear regression and decision tree

## Purpose of the section {.smaller}

- Go again through the modeling workflow (with `tidymodels`) and see that large parts are identical
- Look again at the coefficients of a linear model
- See how the decision tree looks like for a regression problem
- Compare the two most common performance measures for regression models: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared

## Specify recipe and models {.smaller}

- We specify a recipe to predict `body_mass_g` with all available variables in `penguins` and put it in a workflow
    - Typically, more pre-processing steps are specified here, but we are mostly fine

```{r}
#| echo: true
peng_recipe2 <- recipe(body_mass_g ~ ., data = penguins) |> 
 step_rm(year)
peng_workflow2 <- workflow() |> 
 add_recipe(peng_recipe2)
```

Which model is better in prediction? [**Linear regression.** The R-squared is higher.]{.fragment}


## What RMSE is better? {.smaller}

. . .

**Lower. The lower the error, the better the model's prediction.**

It is the other way round than R-squared! Do not confuse them.

. . .

Notes: 

- The common method to fit a linear model is the *ordinary least squares* (OLS) method
- That means the fitted parameters should deliver the lowest possible sum of squared errors (SSE) between predicted and observed values. 
- Minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) is identical to minimizing the mean of squared errors (MSE) because it only adds the factor $1/n$.
- Minimizing the mean of squared errors (MSE) is identical to minimizing the root mean of squared errors (RMSE) because the square root is strictly monotone function.

Conclusion: RMSE can be seen as a definition of the OLS optimization goal. 

## Interpreting RMSE {.smaller}

In contrast to R-squared, RMSE can only be interpreted with knowledge about the range and of the response variable! It also has the same unit (grams for `body_mass_g`).


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| fig-height: 1.8
peng_test |> 
 ggplot(aes(x=body_mass_g, fill = species)) + 
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) + 
 theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| fig-height: 1.8
peng_linreg_pred |> 
 ggplot(aes(x=.pred, fill = species)) + 
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) + 
 theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
#| fig-height: 1.8
peng_regtree_pred |> 
 ggplot(aes(x=.pred, fill = species)) + 
 geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) + 
 theme_minimal(base_size = 20)
```



The RMSE shows many grams predicted values deviate from the true value on average. (Taking the squaring of differences and root of the average into account.)

Where is the prediction better? (Lower RMSE, higher R-squared)

. . . 

Performance is better for training data (compare values to testing data of the same model). Why? It was used to fit. The model is optimized to predict the training data.


## Make a deeper tree {.smaller}

- In `decision_tree()` we can set the maximal depth of the tree to 30.   
- The trees we had before were also automatically *pruned* by sensible defaults.  
- By setting the cost complexity parameter to -1 we avoid pruning.^[The details of this go beyond the scope of this course.]  

```{r}
#| echo: true
peng_regtree_deep <- decision_tree(
 cost_complexity = -1,
 tree_depth = 30
) |>
 set_engine("rpart") |>
 set_mode("regression")
peng_regtree_deep_fit <- peng_workflow2 |> add_model(peng_regtree_deep) |> 
 fit(data = peng_train)
```

## The deep tree

```{r}
rpart.plot(peng_regtree_deep_fit$fit$fit$fit, 
           roundint=FALSE, tweak=1)
```

# What do we mean by "model"? How to be specific

## "Model" in Statistical Learning {.smaller}

We already had the difference between *variable-based* and *agent-based* models in earlier lectures.

But even in the variable-based model setting of **statistical learning**, the term *model* can be more or less abstract: 

1. Very general: $Y = f(X_1, \dots, X_m) + \varepsilon$ where $Y$ is the response variable and $X_i$ are features which we put in our **model**: the abstract and unknown function $f$.   
$\varepsilon$ is the *error* which we can never explain usually do not know. 
2. More specific: The **model** $f$ could already be of a specific type, like *logistic regression*, a *decision tree* or other functional forms. As this need not be the *real* function we may call it *assumed model* $\hat f$   For example a linear model $\hat f(X_1, \dots, X_m) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_m X_m + \varepsilon$. Now, the model has specified parameters which values are unknown. 


## More specific: Fitted model {.smaller}

3. Fitted model: When we have a data set with values for $Y, X_1, \dots, X_m$ we can fit values for the parameters $\hat\beta_0, \dots, \hat\beta_m$ to the data. This is the *fitted model* $\hat f$. This is called parameter estimation: We estimate $\hat\beta_0, \dots, \hat\beta_m$ with the hope that they match the *real* values $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_m$ and that the linear model $\hat f$ matches the *real* function $f$. 
4. Now we could specify further to fit a specific parameterized model with a specific algorithm, and a specific set of hyperparameters, and maybe more ...
    
Sometimes model means only a certain aspect of all these, for example the *formula* like `sex ~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + body_mass_g + species + island`

. . .

[Take away:]{style='color:blue;'} "Model" can mean things with very different granularity. That is OK because they are all related and all fit the definition of being a **simplified representation of reality**.
